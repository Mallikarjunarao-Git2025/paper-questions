# Paper Question Sheets

For math and music quizes.

Uses the [ABC JS music transcription library](https://abcjs.net/).

## Things I Learned

Coming into this project I had never used a JS asset bundler. I was also unfamiliar with using NPM packages and package.json config.

I'm using [Parcel](https://parceljs.org) to build / bundle the app. Parcel is "zero config" if you don't count configing your npm `package.json` file. For example:

    "devDependencies": {
        "parcel-bundler": "^1.11.0"
    },

    "dependencies": {
        "abcjs": "^5.6.1"
    }

Dependencies are installed from the command line:

    npm install

The `abcjs` dependency can now be imported within the `index.js` Javascript:

    import ABCJS from 'abcjs';
    ABCJS.renderAbc('paper', 'ABC');

In development mode, view app on [http://localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234) by running:

    parcel index.html

To bundle-up a production distribution, run:

    parcel build index.html

## [Heroku](https://heroku.com) Deployment

This was a battle, but I won. ‚öîÔ∏è [musical-bears.herokuapp.com](https://musical-bears.herokuapp.com/) ‚öîÔ∏è

Our Heroku build requirements:

* Must recognized NPM package.json config and install required modules.
* Must run Parcel to bundle the app to the `dist` folder.
* Must deploy an HTTP server to host bundled app from the `dist` folder.

After much battle with Heroku's auto-recognized default NodeJS buildpack I switched to a custom buildpack pipeline. I used the official nodejs buildpack and the experimental [static HTML/JS app buildpack](https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-static); see the [static buildpack getting started guide](https://gist.github.com/hone/24b06869b4c1eca701f9) for details.

Here's how I deployed from the CLI. These instructions assume that you have the [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli) installed.

From the command line:

    heroku login
    heroku create
    heroku buildpacks:clear
    heroku buildpacks:add heroku/nodejs
    heroku buildpacks:add https://github.com/hone/heroku-buildpack-static
    touch static.json

Open the `static.json` file and configure heroku-buildpack-static to host the `index.html` in Parcel's `dist` folder. The `static.json` file should look like this:

    {
        "root": "dist/"
    }

And back at the CLI:

    git add .
    git -m "Added a static.json config file for heroku-buildpack-static."
    git push heroku master
    heroku open

## [Surge](https://surge.sh) Deployment

This was not a battle, but app must be locally built.

üåä [musical-bears.surge.sh](https://musical-bears.surge.sh/) üåä

With surge you can deploy any folder. When using a JS bunlder you need to build the app locally first, and then deploy with surge.

I installed the surge CLI as a dev dependency to test it out:

    npm install --save-dev surge

And added an entry in the `package.json` scripts section:

    "scripts": {
        "dev": "parcel index.html",
        "build": "parcel build index.html",
        "surge": "surge"
    }

I then ran parcel's build and the surge CLI:

    npm run build
    npm run surge

The first time through I was prompted to create an account.

**Important:** The surge CLI will prompt for the project folder. Add parcel's `dist` folder to the end of the default path to ensure you're deploying the bundled app.

## GitHub Pages Deployment

Easy-peasy once again. I had to deploy as `paper-questions` because that's the name of the associated GitHub repo:

üìñ [stungeye.github.io/paper-questions/](https://stungeye.github.io/paper-questions/)  üìñ

Install the `gp-pages` package as a development dependency:

    npm install --save-dev gh-pages

Update `package.json` with new scripts:

    "scripts": {
        "dev": "parcel index.html",
        "build": "parcel build index.html",
        "build-gh-pages": "parcel build index.html --public-url /paper-questions",
        "deploy-gh-pages": "gh-pages -d dist"
    }

From the CLI:

    npm run build-gh-pages
    npm run deploy-gh-pages
